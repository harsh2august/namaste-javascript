//fn binds together with its lexical environment forms a closure.

//a fn bundles with its lexical envirnment forms a closure.

//fn+lexical scope=closure.


//fn y has acess to its parent lexical scope.

//In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.

//now we have return fn y, so it no longer recides inside x. so how this will behave outside other lexical scope.

//as z is outside the fn. so how it will behave.

c();//7


//after line no 74, x is gone. so how c() will find var a.

//even fn returned from another fn, it mainitained their lexical scope from where it came.


//so there was a. it has a strong binding.

//when we return y, then not just the fn code returned, but the whole closure was returned.

//i.e closure enclosed fn & its lexical scope was returned. it was came in z.

//so if we exe z somewhere, it still remember var a.



//in interview, closure: fn bundled together with its lexical env forms closures. give this example now.

//fn remember everything..
